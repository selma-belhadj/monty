# monty
`Monty` is a scripting language that is first compiled into monty byte codes (Just like python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. **`monty`** is an interpreter built specially for the Monty Bytecodes files.

## Synopsis
> This repository illustrates how to create a dynamic library in Linux. To read how to do so, read my blog here

### Description of what each file shows:
0. create_dynamic_lib.sh - shell script to create dynamic library named liball.so
1. libholberton.so - created this dynamic library containing some functions as liball.so
2. functions_folder - all .c files hold functions; all .o files were used to create dynamic library
3. holberton.h - included function prototypes of functions in library
4. len - executable program to run 0-main.c
5. 100-operations.so - created this C dynamic library to be imported into python program 100-tests.py
